		 * 
		 *	Thread = A thread of execution in a program 
		 *  (kind of line a virtual CPU). The Java Virtual
		 *  Machine allows an application to have multiple
		 *  threads running concurrently. 
		 *  Each thread has a priority
		 *  Each thread can execute parts of your code in 
		 *  parallel with the main thread
		 *  Threads with higher priority are executed in preference
		 *  compared to threads with a lower priority
		 * 
		 * The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) continues to execute threads
		 * until either of the following occurs:
		 * 
		 * 		1. The exit method of the class Runtime is called.
		 * 		2. All user threads have died
		 * 
		 * When the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts up, there is a thread
		 * which calls the main method. 
		 * This thread is called 'main'
		 *
